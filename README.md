## My Hobbies

I play Rugby since 2016 in Anoia Rugby Club and it's actually one of my favourite hobbies. Rugby it's a contact sport where you have to plant the ball in the try zone of the opposing team.

Since I started my Degree, I discovered another hobbie, computing. I like to code and make my own projects, play with different Linus OS and costumize it. I'm interested too in study some cybersecurity.

And I love too listen to music, my favourites genres are Heavy Metal and most of its variants, Rock and Punk, and some of my favourites artist are Blaze Out, Crim Punk Rock, AC/DC, Crisix, Blowfuse and the greatest Pink Floyd
